0," ""pulling forward into a parking spot is more efficient than backing into it""","I started reversing into parking spots when I started working at industrial facilities. If there is ever an emergency or accident and you need to leave, being able to drive straight out of the spot with clear vision is far and away superior to having to try to reverse out (along with anyone else trying to get away).  Reversing into the spot also has the advantage of maintaining control. You can block traffic when you reverse into the spot, and if someone pulls into you, that's their fault. If you block traffic when reversing out of a spot, and if someone pulls into you, it's your fault.","[0.2817850708961487, 0.6963096261024475, 0.02190529927611351]",1
